# Text to Speech Converter (NLP Project)

This is a simple text-to-speech converter project using Python and the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- gTTS library

## Installation

Install the gTTS library using pip:

```
pip install gTTS
```

## Usage

Run the script and enter the text you want to convert to speech:

```
python tts_converter.py
```

The speech will be saved as `output.mp3` in the current directory.

## Notes

- This project uses the Google Text-to-Speech API, so an internet connection is required.
- You can change the language by modifying the `lang` parameter in the script (default is English).
